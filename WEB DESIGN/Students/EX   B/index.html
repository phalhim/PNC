                    <span>Reappraisal</span>is an emotion regulation strategy that we can use to reinterpret a sad situation in
                a more
                positive (or less negative) way. Reappraisal is hard for many of us, and if we have a hard time seeing the
                silver linings, this can contribute to higher levels of sadness and depression.
