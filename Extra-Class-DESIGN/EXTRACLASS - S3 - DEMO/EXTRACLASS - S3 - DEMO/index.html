                    <p>Angkor Wat is an enormous Buddhist temple complex located in northern Cambodia. It was originally
                        built in the first half of the 12th century as a Hindu temple. Spread across more than 400
                        acres, Angkor Wat is said to be the largest religious monument in the world. Its name, which
                        translates to “temple city” in the Khmer language of the region, references the fact it was
                        built by Emperor Suryavarman II, who ruled the region from 1113 to 1150, as the state temple and
                        political center of his empire.
